                                    <p>My name is Sergei Piadyshev, Front-end developer. I studied in Ulyanovsk State Technical University at "Publishing Business and Editing" faculty where I for the first time found out how websites are created. At that
                                        time I made my first simple table layout site about Harry Harrison.</p>
                                    <p>But somehow I became more interested in English that is why I decided to try to be a translator in the future. After university completion I worked as freelance translator for 0,5 year and then in a bank support center
                                        for 1 year. Then I found a job of technical translator in a local translation agency where I worked for 3 years.</p>
                                    <p>Finally I realized that I don't enjoy to be a translator anymore in addition to other reasons... and I decided to go back to creation of websites.</p>
